# IMMEDIATE FIX FOR RENDER DEPLOYMENT

## Quick Steps (5 minutes):

1. **Download these files to your project root:**
   - `runtime.txt` (forces Python 3.11.9)
   - `requirements.txt` (compatible package versions)

2. **Add to your project:**
   ```bash
   # In your project directory:
   cp runtime.txt /path/to/your/project/
   cp requirements.txt /path/to/your/project/
   ```

3. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add runtime.txt requirements.txt
   git commit -m "Fix Python 3.13 compatibility issue - use Python 3.11.9"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Redeploy on Render:**
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Click "Manual Deploy" or wait for auto-deploy
   - Monitor build logs for success

## Expected Results:
✅ Python 3.11.9 will be used instead of 3.13.4
✅ Pandas will install from pre-built wheels (no compilation)
✅ Build should complete in ~2-3 minutes instead of failing

## If You Still See Issues:
- Check build logs for any other package conflicts
- Ensure your main app file is named correctly (app.py or main.py)
- Verify your Flask app variable name matches the start command

## Your Flask App Should Work With:
- Python 3.11.9
- Pandas 2.0.3+ (stable)
- Flask 3.0.0
- All scientific computing packages

## Render Service Settings (verify these):
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `gunicorn app:app` (replace `app:app` with your actual app:variable)
- **Python Version**: Should auto-detect from runtime.txt
